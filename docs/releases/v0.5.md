# Release v0.5 (tag: v0.5.0)

Status: **release freeze / pending tag**

This is the canonical, human-readable release note entry for v0.5.

## Scope delivered

- Production-ready **patient stress assessment** flow backed by a data-driven funnel runtime
- Role-based access control for **patients** and **clinicians/admin**
- Deterministic, CI-verified **endpoint catalog** (generator + verifier + allowlist)
- Database hygiene & determinism gates (migration discipline + verification scripts)

## Explicitly not in v0.5 (carry to v0.6)

- New product features or UI expansions beyond bugfixes/hardening
- Endpoint surface area changes not covered by the endpoint catalog gate/allowlist workflow
- Major refactors (v0.5 focuses on stabilization + release readiness)

## Verification checklist

Run these commands from repo root:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

```bash
node scripts/dev/endpoint-catalog/generate.js --repo-root . --out-dir docs/api --allowlist docs/api/endpoint-allowlist.json
pwsh -File scripts/ci/verify-endpoint-catalog.ps1
git status --porcelain
```

Expected: the verifier passes and `git status --porcelain` is empty.
