# v0.4 TODO/FIXME Analysis

**Analysis Date:** December 14, 2025  
**Version:** v0.4.0  
**Status:** ✅ All TODOs acceptable for release

---

## Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the codebase, all remaining TODO/FIXME comments are related to **future monitoring and observability features** that are explicitly planned for v0.5+. None of these TODOs block the v0.4 release.

---

## Found TODOs/FIXMEs

### 1. Monitoring Service Integration (Future)

#### Location: `lib/monitoring/apiWrapper.ts`
```typescript
// TODO: Send metrics to monitoring service (e.g., Prometheus, DataDog)
```
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: Implement actual metrics collection when ready.
 */
```

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable  
**Reason:** Monitoring infrastructure is prepared but not yet integrated. This is explicitly a v0.5+ feature. The code has proper error handling and logging in place.

---

### 2. Error Tracking Service Integration (Future)

#### Location: `lib/logging/logger.ts`
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: Integrate with production error tracking service (Sentry recommended)
 */
```
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: Integrate with Sentry for production error tracking
 */
```

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable  
**Reason:** Sentry integration is prepared but not yet active. The logging framework is complete and functional. Integration with Sentry is planned for v0.5+.

---

### 3. Client-Side Monitoring (Future)

#### Location: `lib/logging/clientLogger.ts`
```typescript
// TODO: Send to monitoring service in production
```
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: Implement actual event collection when ready.
 */
```

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable  
**Reason:** Client-side monitoring hooks are in place. The application logs to console for development. Production monitoring integration is a v0.5+ feature.

---

### 4. Assessment Creation Navigation (Low Priority)

#### Location: `app/clinician/patient/[id]/page.tsx`
```typescript
// TODO: Navigate to new assessment creation
```

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable  
**Reason:** This is a convenience feature for clinicians to create assessments directly from the patient detail page. The core functionality works - clinicians can view patient data and assessments. Adding direct creation is a UX enhancement for v0.5+.

---

## TODOs in Documentation & Scripts

### Documentation TODOs

#### Location: `docs/MONITORING_INTEGRATION.md`
Multiple TODO placeholders for:
- Sentry initialization
- LogRocket setup
- Custom tracking integration
- User identification in monitoring services

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable  
**Reason:** This is a planning document for future monitoring integration. The TODOs are intentional placeholders showing where code will be added in v0.5+.

---

### Script TODOs

#### Location: `scripts/create_v0_4_issues_full.js`
```javascript
// TODO ggf. anpassen:
// TODO comments/placeholders for future monitoring integration
```

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable  
**Reason:** This is a utility script for issue generation. The TODOs are notes for future script maintenance, not production code issues.

---

## Analysis by Scope

### v0.4 Scope (Production Code)
| File | TODOs | Status | Blocks Release? |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `lib/monitoring/apiWrapper.ts` | 2 | Future feature | ❌ No |
| `lib/logging/logger.ts` | 2 | Future feature | ❌ No |
| `lib/logging/clientLogger.ts` | 2 | Future feature | ❌ No |
| `app/clinician/patient/[id]/page.tsx` | 1 | Enhancement | ❌ No |

**Total Production TODOs:** 7  
**Blocking Issues:** 0

### Documentation & Scripts (Non-Production)
| File | TODOs | Status | Blocks Release? |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `docs/MONITORING_INTEGRATION.md` | 8 | Planning doc | ❌ No |
| `scripts/create_v0_4_issues_full.js` | 2 | Utility script | ❌ No |

**Total Documentation TODOs:** 10  
**Blocking Issues:** 0

## Mitigation Strategy

### Current State (v0.4)
- ✅ Logging framework complete and functional
- ✅ Error handling in place throughout application
- ✅ Console logging available for debugging
- ✅ API wrapper with error tracking hooks prepared
- ✅ Client logger with event tracking hooks prepared

### Future Integration (v0.5+)
When ready to integrate monitoring services:

1. **Set up Sentry account** and get API key
2. **Add Sentry SDK** to package.json
3. **Replace TODO comments** with actual Sentry initialization
4. **Configure environment variables** for Sentry DSN
5. **Test in staging** before production rollout
6. **Update documentation** with monitoring procedures

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours for basic Sentry integration

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: ✅ LOW

**Justification:**
1. All TODOs are explicitly for future features
2. Current logging and error handling is functional
3. No missing core functionality
4. Application is production-ready without monitoring integration
5. Monitoring can be added incrementally without code refactoring

---

## Recommendations

### For v0.4 Release
✅ **PROCEED WITH RELEASE**

The presence of these TODOs does not impact:
- Application functionality
- Security
- User experience
- Data integrity
- Performance

### For v0.5 Planning
📋 **Create dedicated monitoring epic:**
- Issue: Integrate Sentry for error tracking
- Issue: Set up metrics collection (Prometheus/DataDog)
- Issue: Implement client-side session replay (LogRocket)
- Issue: Complete assessment creation navigation in clinician view

---

## Conclusion

All TODO/FIXME comments in the v0.4 codebase are:
1. ✅ Documented and understood
2. ✅ Non-blocking for production release
3. ✅ Related to future enhancements
4. ✅ Properly tracked for v0.5+ implementation

**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR v0.4 RELEASE**
